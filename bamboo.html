            <h1>Bamboo Train (ឡូរី)</h1>
            
            <p>
                The Bamboo Train, locally known as "Norry," is one of Battambang's most unique and thrilling 
                attractions. This ingenious form of transportation consists of a bamboo platform mounted on 
                two sets of wheels, powered by a small gasoline engine. It's a one-of-a-kind experience that 
                you won't find anywhere else in the world!
            </p>

            <div class="fun-fact">
                <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
                <p>The Bamboo Train can reach speeds of up to 40 km/h (25 mph) as it rattles along the old 
                French colonial railway tracks. Hold on tight!</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The Bamboo Train operates on a single railway track, which creates an interesting challenge: 
                when two trains meet coming from opposite directions, one must be disassembled to let the 
                other pass! The train with fewer passengers or lighter cargo is typically the one that gets 
                taken apart. The whole process takes just a few minutes, as locals have perfected this 
                routine over many years.
            </p>

            <h2>The Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The journey typically lasts about 30-40 minutes round trip, taking you through beautiful 
                countryside scenery including rice paddies, small villages, and lush vegetation. The wind 
                in your face, the rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the tracks, and the stunning rural 
                landscapes make for an unforgettable adventure.
            </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The Bamboo Train was born out of necessity during the 1980s when Cambodia's railway system 
                had been destroyed during years of conflict. Locals created this innovative solution to 
                transport people and goods along the unused tracks. What started as a practical solution 
                has now become one of Cambodia's most popular tourist attractions.
