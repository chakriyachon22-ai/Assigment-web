            <h1>Phnom Sampov (ភ្នំសំពៅ)</h1>
            
            <p>
                Phnom Sampov is one of Battambang's most iconic landmarks, rising approximately 100 meters above 
                the surrounding rice fields. This limestone mountain is known for its stunning natural beauty, 
                ancient temples, and the famous bat cave spectacle that occurs every evening at sunset.
            </p>

            <h2>The Bat Caves</h2>
            <p>
                Every evening around 5:30-6:00 PM, millions of bats emerge from the caves at Phnom Sampov, 
                creating a spectacular natural phenomenon. The bats fly out in a continuous stream that can 
                last for 30-45 minutes, heading to the rice fields to feed on insects. This incredible sight 
                is one of the most popular attractions for visitors to Battambang.
            </p>

                <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                <p>Arrive around 5:00 PM to climb the mountain and find a good viewing spot for the bat exodus. 
                The sunset views combined with the bat phenomenon make for an unforgettable experience.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>
                Phnom Sampov holds a darker chapter in Cambodia's history. During the Khmer Rouge regime 
                (1975-1979), the mountain was used as an execution site. Today, there are memorial sites 
                and Buddhist shrines that serve as reminders of this tragic period, offering visitors a 
                place for reflection and remembrance.
            </p>

            <h2>Temples and Pagodas</h2>
            <p>
                At the summit of Phnom Sampov, you'll find beautiful Buddhist temples and pagodas with 
                ornate decorations and golden statues. The temples are active places of worship, and 
                monks still reside here. The peaceful atmosphere and panoramic views make it a perfect 
                place for meditation and contemplation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The journey to the top can be made by motorbike or on foot. While the climb is challenging, 
                the breathtaking 360-degree views of the Battambang countryside, with its patchwork of 
                rice paddies and palm trees, make every step worthwhile.
