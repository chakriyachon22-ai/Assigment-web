            <p>
                Battambang is Cambodia's second-largest city, yet it retains a peaceful, small-town 
                atmosphere that makes it the perfect escape from the busier tourist destinations. 
                With its well-preserved French colonial architecture, thriving arts scene, and 
                stunning countryside, Battambang offers visitors an authentic glimpse into Cambodian life.
